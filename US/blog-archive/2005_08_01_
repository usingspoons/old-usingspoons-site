Yeasts from the air land on the surface and start to grow and multiply. The yeast consumes the sugars from the wheat, and produces carbon dioxide. Bubbles appear. Bacteria also start to colonise the paste, feeding on other sugars that the yeast does not consume.<br /><br />This dual colony grows, produces lactic acid, produces carbon dioxide. More flour is added, more water, a dough is made. The proteins in the flour join to make a long protein, which is developed by working the dough. it is stretched away, pulled back, turned. The surface becomes smooth, stretchy, soft. The yeast trapped within the proteins keeps growing, producing carbon dioxide. The bacteria keep growing, keep producing lactic acid. The dough swells, becomes puffy, pillowy. It is moulded, shaped, the surface tightens, dries. The dough is put into the warm oven. The yeast grows faster, the gases expand, the dough stretches. And then, the heat is higher, the yeast dies, the protein sets and stiffens. Moisture in the oven gelatinises the starch, creates a stiff shiny exterior. The starch caramelizes, browns, darkens.<br /><br />And you have a loaf of bread. Just as the Egyptians would have made, just as the goldminers made in California, just as the French have been making for centuries. And it tastes good too.<br clear="all" /><br />

  The Wisdom of Stephen Fry</a>
</span><br />
      I used to love the Observer magazine's column titled "This much I know" (it was one of the only things worth reading in there - along with Nigel Slater). I haven't read it in a while, California not having very many places where you can buy the Observer, but I'm very glad that <a href="http://www.greenfairy.com/archives/000729.html">Green Fairy</a> pointed me to <a href="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/magazine/story/0,11913,1547196,00.html">this one by Stephen Fry</a>:<br /><blockquote>"...coriander is a giant hoax perpetrated by a perverted society"</blockquote><br />

  Philadephia Story</a>
</span><br />
      The cinema in the centre of Palo Alto, <a href="http://cinematreasures.org/theater/404/">The Stanford</a>, has recently reopened after a 3 month refurbishment. It's a great little cinema, with original features now restored, and has a working Wurlitzer organ which is used before and after performances, and is also used to provide music when they screen silent films.<br /><br />I am looking forward to many films in t<a href="http://www.stanfordtheatre.org/">he programme</a> for the next couple of months, but one of my favourites came up in the first week - <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032904/?fr=c2l0ZT1kZnxteD0yMHxsbT01MDB8dHQ9MXxmYj11fHBuPTB8cT1waGlsYWRlbHBoaWEgc3Rvcnl8aHRtbD0xfG5tPTE_;fc=1;ft=21;fm=1">The Philadelphia Story</a>. In case you don't already know (and check the link for more details), this comedy stars Katharine Hepburn, James Stewart and Cary Grant - you could not wish for a more wonderful cast.<br /><br />I won't rehash the story here - you'll just have to go and watch it yourselves - but a few things struck me about it when I was re-watching it in the cinema. The first was that the dialogue was so sharp and fast - it was the sort of blink-and-you'll-miss-it repartee that you very seldom see now. The best current parallel I can think of is The Simpsons at it's best: so filled with jokes and current affairs references that you're lucky if you can catch them all in one viewing.<br /><br />The other thing that struck me about the film was how ambiguous the plot was. You have 3 people vying for the heroine's affection, and while one is obviously unsuitable, the remaining two (Jimmy Stewart and Cary Grant, of course) both have their wonderful moments as well as their faults. Every time I watch, I wait to see who she'll pick. I can think of very few modern romantic comedies that you can say that about.<br /><br />And my favourite part? Jimmy Stewart and Katharine Hepburn getting drunk and more drunk...<br />

Good dark chocolate consists only of cocoa solids, cocoa butter, sugar and probably a little vanilla and lecithin (an emulsifier) to help it all stay together. It is particularly the cocoa butter which gives chocolate such unique properties. It is solid at room temperature, but melts quickly at around body temperature, giving it those melt-in-the-mouth properties. <br /><br />The fats in cocoa butter tend to form large crystals, which can be of 4 different types. Only one of these types, the beta crystals, is a stable form. When you buy chocolate, it is tempered, meaning that the fat is mostly in beta crystals. This means that the chocolate is shiny, will snap when you break it, and will melt at a slightly higher temperature (95F/ 35C). Once you melt the chocolate, other crystal types will prevail, and the cocoa butter might separate from the cocoa, forming white blotches or streaks (you sometimes see this when you leave a chocolate bar in the sun and then cool it down again).<br /><br />So the trick is to melt the chocolate, so that you can make shapes, or truffles whilst maintaining that shiny glossy look of tempered chocolate. And let me tell you, it's quite tricky! The idea is to melt the chocolate enough to disrupt all the crystals, then to cool it to just the temperature where the beta crystals will readily form, and then raise the temperature enough to melt any unstable crystals, but not so far as to melt the beta crystals. <br /><br />As you can see from the photo, I was successful at least a couple of times. The particularly shiny finish is due to moulding the tempered chocolate in plastic moulds.<br clear="all" /><br />

  Sonoma</a>
</span><br />
      We spent last weekend in Sonoma with my parents. Sonoma is the neighbouring valley to Napa, with just as many vineyards but slightly nicer views and fewer tourists. We stayed just outside Healdsburg, a small town with a little plaza in the center which I'm sure triples or quadruples in population on weekends. Arriving Friday night, we spent Saturday wine tasting and driving around the various vineyards, and then meandered back to the Peninsula on Sunday (where it was foggy).<br /><br />The countryside around there is really beautiful - a lot like the wine growing regions in the south of France or in Italy, but greener. There is a winery about every 20 yards and most of them do tastings, so you can just drop in and taste their wines (although some charge a tasting fee which is refunded if you buy a bottle). <br /><br />We decided to take a tour of one of the larger wineries in the Dry Creek area, <a href="http://www.ferrari-carano.com/">Ferrari-Carano</a>. It is owned by a couple from Reno who made their money in property and casinos, and created a winery in Sonoma. They have built a beautiful house and enormous winery with gardens (although it all betrays Bellagio-esque touches - fountains, faux-italian villas). The tour was very good, though - the tour guide really knew her stuff. After that, we had to taste some of their wines. They were good, but none were remarkable. One unusual wine was their <a href="http://www.ferrari-carano.com/ourwines/wineinfo.aspx?id=19">Black Muscat</a>, which I'd never tasted before. It's a dessert wine that tastes of cherries and chocolate - a bit like a cross between a red wine and muscat. They served it at the winery with chocolate-coated, wine-soaked dried cherries - mmmmm. So we bought a couple of bottles of that :)<br /><br />That evening we ate at Dry Creek Kitchen, a restaurant in Healdsburg. Very unusual dishes, included a soft-boiled egg with asparagus puree injected into it. All very good though. <br />

  Offally good?</a>
</span><br />
      Last week we covered Offal at cooking school. I was determined to at least taste everything we did, so here are the verdicts, saving you the trouble of sampling them all for yourselves:<br /><br /><b>Heart</b><br />We prepared <a href="http://travel.peru.com/travel/idocs/2002/9/16/DetalleDocumento_46857.asp">beef heart Peruvian-style</a> by slicing it very thin, marinading it overnight in a spicy marinade and then barbequing it over charcoal. It was actually very good - meaty with a slightly softer texture than beef.<br /><br /><b>Tongue</b><br />Also beef, this was not a pleasant dish to prepare. The whole tongue is boiled for several hours with vegetables, then peeled (yes, peeled) while still warm. The whole thing is then pressed and cooled (to make it look less like what it is) and sliced thinly and served cold with a gribiche sauce of herbs, capers and chopped hard boiled egg. The sauce was good - the texture of the tongue was too soft for me.<br /><br /><b>Kidneys</b><br />This was another dish that was not at all pleasant to prepare. The kidneys (lambs') were split in half and trimmed, then pan-fryed over high heat and finished with a mustard-butter sauce. The sauce was good. The smell emanating from the frying kidneys was not - after all, we all know <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney">what kidneys do in the body</a> ...<br /><br /><b>Liver</b><br />We prepared pan-fried calves' liver with caramelised onions and a red wine and cream sauce. This was also good - a much more meaty texture than most of the organs. It was tricky to get it cooked just right though - when over-cooked it had a mealy texture.<br /><br /><b>Sweetbreads</b><br />Sweetbreads is the rather euphemistic name given to either the thymus (from calves and other young animals) or the pancreas (from older animals). These were poached, then cooled and pressed and some of the membranes removed. They were then coated in seasoned flour and pan-fried to make them crispy and served with a black butter sauce and capers. These weren't bad - a slightly creamy texture which worked well as long as the outside got good and crispy. Not something I'd order in a restaurant or make, but I would eat it if it were presented to me.<br /><br /><b>Tripe</b><br />As I'm sure you know, tripe is cow's stomach. Sounds appetising already, doesn't it? This was brought to a boil in salted water, then drained and simmered for 6 hours with vegetables. It was then drained, rolled up and chilled. Once cold, we sliced it into thin strips, coated in flour and fried over high heat to make it crispy. This was also served with caramelised onions. It didn't really taste of anything (perhaps not surprising after all that boiling). The crispy parts were fine, but the texture of the rest was predictably gelatinous. That, plus the fact that it smelled disgusting while boiling made it very much not worth the effort.<br /><br /><b>Oxtail</b><br />Not technically offal (it's just the tail) but requires a little bit of elaborate preparation as it is mostly bone and quite fatty. It made a very good, rich beef stew.<br /><br />If this has whetted your appetite, firstly you're a better eater than me, and secondly, you should check out Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall's latest tome, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0340826355/qid=1123047955/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl/202-6110246-5387832">The River Cottage Meat Book</a>, which has all these and the even more scary <a href="http://www.answers.com/lights&amp;r=67">Lights</a> and Fries (also known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Mountain_oysters">Rocky Mountain Oysters</a>).<br /><br /><!-- technorati tags start --><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/food" rel="tag">food</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/offal" rel="tag">offal</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --><br />
