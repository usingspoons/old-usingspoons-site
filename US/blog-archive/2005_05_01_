  Jeans Genius</a>
</span><br />
      This one is a little off-topic, as it's not food related - although that probably comes as a relief to some of you.<br /><br />A few weeks ago I noticed that the <a href="http://www.us.levi.com">Levi's</a> Store in San Francisco was due to get a body scanning machine in. Having seen something similar on Tomorrow's World many moons ago (not to mention <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070707/?fr=c2l0ZT1kZnxteD0yMHxsbT01MDB8dHQ9b258ZmI9dXxwbj0wfHE9c2xlZXBlcnxodG1sPTF8bm09b24_;fc=1;ft=20;fm=1">Woody Allen's Sleeper</a>), I wanted to have a go and took a note of the dates. I also wanted to find some low-rise jeans that actually fitted, so I had a good excuse too.<br /><br />So yesterday I popped into the store on the way back from school and the machine was there, scanning away. It is produced by <a href="http://www.intellifit.com">Intellifit</a>, who work with a number of companies, usign their scanner to take measurements which are then compared to a company database to find styles and sizes to match. They also aggregate the data anonymously to give retailers feedback on the actual sizes of the clothes-buying public (like that much publicised M&S survey a few years ago).<br /><br />The scanner is a big cylindrical clear booth that you stand in the centre of while a vertical arm rotates around you. It uses short-range radio waves to detect the water in your skin, so it can take accurate measurements through your clothes. A Levi's sales person asks you what sort of jeans you're looking for before the scan (on the waist or below, fitted or relaxed) so that they can pull a relevant list of styles for your size. You have to remove big pieces of metal (watches, belt buckles) but otherwise it's pretty hassle-free and very quick (but there was no queue when I was there).<br /><br />And did it work? Well, of the 4 styles it recommended, one was the exact pair I was wearing at the time, the other 3 fitted, and I bought one of those (the <a href="http://www.us.levi.com/spr05a/levi/prod/l_prod.jsp?FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=2534374305312503&bmUID=1116479502585">515s</a>, for those who care)! It's only there this week, but this is a trial for Levi's, so maybe you'll see them in a store near you at some point.<br />

  Methods of Cooking</a>
</span><br />
      An important aspect of cooking, but one that is often overlooked, is the possible methods. When you buy a piece of meat for dinner, the methods are all the ways that you can cook what you have bought. Being familiar with them allows you to make the most appropriate choice for the ingredients you have. Probably the most versatile piece of meat is the chicken - it can be cooked using all the methods listed here.<br /><br /><table><tbody><tr valign="top"><th align="left">Category</th><th align="left">Methods</th><th align="left">Description</th><th align="left" valign="top">Examples</th></tr><tr valign="top"><td rowspan="3" valign="top">Moist Heat</td><td valign="top">Boiling</td><td valign="top">In rapidly moving water at 100C. Although the temperature is relatively low, the movement and density of the water convey heat efficiently to the food.</td><td valign="top">Firm, green vegetables, pasta, boiled eggs.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Poaching</td><td valign="top">In 'shimmering' water at less than 100C. Slower than boiling but the gentle movement and lower temperature mean that this method is suitable for more delicate foods.</td><td valign="top">Fish, eggs and chicken breasts.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Steaming</td><td valign="top">In water vapour above 100C. Slower than boiling due to the lower density of steam, but this is compensated for by a slightly increased temperature.</td><td valign="top">Helps retain flavour and juices. Good for green vegetables and fish.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3" valign="top">Dry Heat</td><td valign="top">Roasting</td><td valign="top">In an oven with fat - generally 150-220C. High temperatures combined with the fat will enable the outside to brown, but the cooking must also be long and slow enough for the heat to penetrate to the centre of the food.</td><td valign="top">Large cuts of tender foods - whole fish, joints of meat, hard vegetables.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Baking</td><td valign="top">In the oven, generally 150-200C. Similar to roasting but without a coating of fat, the food is less likely to brown and more likely to dry out.</td><td valign="top">Cakes, meat, fish or vegetables if they're in a sauce - tender cuts.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Grilling</td><td>Below (or above in the case of a barbeque grill) a powerful heat source. This caramelises the outside, and means that the piece must be thin enough to cook through before the outside dries out or burns.</td><td valign="top">Thin, tender cuts of meat and fish.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="4" valign="top">In fat</td><td valign="top">Pan Frying</td><td valign="top">Frying in a small amount of fat at a high heat to brown the outside.</td><td valign="top">Tender cuts of meat or fish. If very thick, can be finished in the oven.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sauteing</td><td valign="top">Cooking in a small amount of fat, over high heat, with a lot of motion (Sauter = jump in french).</td><td valign="top">Small pieces of robust food that will not be damaged by shaking in the pan - vegetables and chicken pieces.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Stir frying</td><td valign="top">Cooking over a very, <b>very</b> high heat, with lots of motion to evenly cook everything in the pan/wok.</td><td valign="top">As for saute - small pieces of robust but tender foods.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deep frying</td><td valign="top">Cooking in hot oil that the food can be submerged into. This browns the outside, but will not cook the inside thoroughly unless the pieces are small.</td><td valign="top">Vegetables (chips and crisps!); wet vegetables, fish or meat if coated in batter - all in small or thin pieces.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2" valign="top">Combination</td><td valign="top">Braising</td><td valign="top">Cooking for a long time at a low temperature. Begin by browning (in fat) then bake in a small amount of liquid.</td><td valign="top">The low temperature and liquid mean than the connective tissue in toough cuts of meat can be converted into gelatine, making the meat tender (lamb shanks are a good example). On the other hand, tender pieces, without much connective tissue or fat, will overcook.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Stewing</td><td valign="top">Very similar to braising, combining an initial browning with long cooking in liquid, but this time enough liquid to submerge all the components.</td><td valign="top">Same cuts of meat as braising - tough pieces like beef chuck or braising steak, chicken thighs and legs, lamb shanks, oxtail.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3" valign="top">Encased</td><td valign="top">In paper/foil</td><td valign="top">Basically steaming, using the case to trap steam released from the food. The case also means that flavours and aromas will be trapped too.</td><td valign="top">Anything that can be steamed - fish, chicken breasts, pork loin or tenderloin, as well as veggies.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">In pastry</td><td valign="top">The same principle applies - the pastry traps steam and juices, and also provides a contrasting texture. Pastry can be edible (like beef wellington) or a flour and water crust that must be removed before eating.</td><td valign="top">Tender cuts that are suitable for e.g. roasting. The pastry protects, allowing longer cooking than parchment.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">In salt crust</td><td valign="top">Salt crusts are usually made from rock salt combined with egg whites, to make an inedible crust, a little like flour and water pastry crusts. As the crust is removed before serving, food does not taste overly salty.</td><td valign="top">Works well for whole fish and poultry, where the salt can easily be removed from the skin.</td></tr></tbody></table><br />

  Elizabeth David</a>
</span><br />
      Each Friday one of the students at Tante Marie's gives a little 5 minute talk on a food person - a chef, restauranteur or food writer. This week it's my turn to give a report on Elizabeth David, so I thought I would give you a little summary of it here.<br /><br />Elizabeth David was probably the most influential english food writer of the 20th century. She was born  in 1914, educated privately in England and then sent to study at the Sorbonne in Paris at 17. There she lived with a French family who gave her her introduction to French cuisine. When she returned to London, she pursued an acting career for a while, then in 1938 she left for Crete via Antibes. She spent the whole war abroad, first  in Greece, and later in Egypt where she worked for the British civil service.<br />She returned to England in 1946, to a country just out of war and still in the depths of rationing. Faced with the shortage of meat and fresh food, and the array of substitutes that had been concocted to deal with  rationing, she attempted to recreate her experiences abroad by writing down the food she remembered and could not recreate through lack of ingredients. This frustration with post-war English food and suppliers was to drive and inform much of her writing. Her writings at this time formed the basis of her first book, Medittaranean Food in 1950.<br />From 1950 to 1965, Elizabeth David published a further 4 books on French and Italian food, and countless magazine articles for the Sunday Times, the Spectator, Vogue, Food and Wine and Gourmet magazines, amongst many others. <br /><br />She continued to write and travel throughout the sixties, as well as opening her own kitchen shop in London and in the seventies published two books on English food - English Bread and Yeast Cookery and Spices and Aromatics in the English Kitchen. Her trilogy on English Food was completed with The Harvest of the Cold Months, published after her death.<br />It is hard to overstate the importance of Elizabeth David's writing. She brought the fresh flavours and simple preparation of Mediterranean cuisine to an England which had been making wartime dishes for 5 years and where olive oil was only available from the chemist. She was instrumental in persuading shops to stock such oddities as pasta, aubergines (eggplant) and courgettes (zucchini). As restaurant cooking made a resurgence in the sixties and seventies, she was often critical (to the point of cruelty) of the fashion for elaborate garnishes of lettuce leaves, curly parsley and carved vegetables.<br />She influenced virtually all British chefs who came after her and cooked Mediterranean-inspired food. Alice Waters (owner of Chez Panisse in Berkeley) began cooking in California from French Country Cooking. The Acme Bread company (also in Berkeley) was founded on English Bread and Yeast Cookery. Jane Grigson called her "the greatest food writer of her time". <br />And her favourite place to eat lunch in San Francisco was an Italian place called Vivande porta via, run by one Carlo Middione, who has been teaching us Italian cooking at Tante Marie's in the past few weeks.<br />
