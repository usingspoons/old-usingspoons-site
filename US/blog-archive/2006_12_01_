  January Cooking</a>
</span><br />
      In the reading time afforded by the Christmas holidays, I have been composing a list of recipes to tackle in the next few weeks. This started out at a mental list, but then I committed it to post-it, and now I'm posting it for the world to see - in the hope that it will help me actually tackle them all.<br /><br /><a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.channel4.com/life/microsites/N/nigella/xmasbites2.shtml#recipe2">Lentil & Chestnut Soup</a> from <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0701180331?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=usingmainlysp-21&linkCode=as2&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;camp=1634&creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=0701180331">Feast: Food That Celebrates Life</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=usingmainlysp-21&l=as2&amp;o=2&a=0701180331" alt="" style="border: medium none  ! important; margin: 0px ! important;" border="0" height="1" width="1" /> by Nigella Lawson<br />I made this a couple of years ago, and spent ages trying to remember where I got the recipe from. All I remembered that it had chestnuts, and was the best, most wintry soup I made that year. This one I accomplished this afternoon - there's no picture, because it's not the most exciting soup to look at, as you might expect from the ingredients list.<br /><br /><a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.channel4.com/life/microsites/N/nigella/xmasbites3.shtml">Rudolph Pie</a> also from Feast<br />This is to use up the cold venison I have in my fridge from Boxing Day at my parents house. Going to do this tomorrow.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Marmalade</span><br />The Blood Orange Marmalade I made last year is nearly out, so time to  make some more as soon as Seville Oranges are in the shops. This year I will either use the recipe from my new copy of the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1841882046?ie=UTF8&tag=usingmainlysp-21&amp;linkCode=as2&camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&creativeASIN=1841882046">The Cranks Bible</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=usingmainlysp-21&amp;l=as2&o=2&amp;a=1841882046" alt="" style="border: medium none  ! important; margin: 0px ! important;" border="0" height="1" width="1" /> or from MFK Fisher's description of her family recipe in <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0099422646?ie=UTF8&tag=usingmainlysp-21&amp;linkCode=as2&camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&creativeASIN=0099422646">With Bold Knife and Fork</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=usingmainlysp-21&amp;l=as2&o=2&amp;a=0099422646" alt="" style="border: medium none  ! important; margin: 0px ! important;" border="0" height="1" width="1" />. This one sounds like it could be wonderful, but includes no very specific quantities and requires 3 days!<br /><br />Pumpkin & Mango Chutney Parcels<br />Pasta stuffed with the butternut squash I've got sitting in the vegetable box.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ginger Cake</span><br />Ginger cake always goes down well in our house - it lasts ages, and goes very well with tea. <a href="http://lifeandhealth.guardian.co.uk/experts/danlepard/story/0,,1937937,00.html">Dan Lepard's recipe in the Guardian</a> a few weeks ago looks like a good one.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Chips</span><br />Jeffrey Steingarten's article on the perfect French Fry in <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0747260974?ie=UTF8&tag=usingmainlysp-21&amp;linkCode=as2&camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&creativeASIN=0747260974">The Man Who Ate Everything</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=usingmainlysp-21&amp;l=as2&o=2&amp;a=0747260974" alt="" style="border: medium none  ! important; margin: 0px ! important;" border="0" height="1" width="1" /> includes a description of how to make chips at home following Joel Robuchon's home method. The idea is apparently to put the cold cut-up potatoes into cold oil and heat the whole thing up together, thereby giving them the first cooler cooking followed by the hotter second frying, all in one go.<br />

I took the precaution of using <a href="http://chocolateandzucchini.com/archives/2006/11/le_pain_quon_ne_petrit_pas.php">Clothilde's translation</a> to grams, rather than those unreliable cups, having heard some reports of failures. This is my fourth go with it, and I have found it a very reliable recipe, consistently rising high and developing a very lovely crust. I have also combined it with some sourdough starter to get a slightly sour loaf. I am particularly enthusiastic about it as something that I can realistically tackle during the week, in just the time I have after work, between cooking dinner and eating dinner.<br /><br /><strong>European No-Knead Bread</strong><br />470g plain flour (I usually use half plain and half bread flour)<br />350g water = 350ml<br />10g salt - about 1.5 tsp<br />1/4 tsp yeast<br /><br />Mix the salt and yeast into the flour in a large bowl so they are evenly distributed. Pour in the water and mix with your fingers just until you get a single doughy mass that pulls away from the bowl. Then stop. Scrape your fingers off, and cover the bowl with cling film or a tea towel, and leave on your kitchen counter for 12-18 hours. I have left it for 20 hours in a cool kitchen and it was fine. You can make this last thing at night and return to it the next day after work.<br /><br />Scrape the dough out of the bowl with a spatula, onto a floured worktop. Press the dough down with your fingertips and fold the left side over one third, then the right (like folding a letter). Flatten the dough a little again and fold top to bottom in the same way.<br /><br />Sprinkle a teatowel with flour and some cornmeal/polenta or wheat bran if you have it. Place the down seam side down on the towel, and fold the edges over it. Leave for 2 hours to rise again. After an hour and a half, take a Pyrex or cast iron casserole dish with a lid, and put it into the cold oven. Heat it as hot as it will go - as close to 250C as you can.<br /><br />After the 2 hours are up, take out the casserole, use the towel to tip in the dough (you don't have to be too delicate) and put the hot lid back on. Return to the oven for 30 minutes, then remove the lid and bake for 15 more minutes to brown the top and develop the crust further.<br /><br />Then take it out and tip onto a wire rack. Allow it to cool before slicing - and eating with lots of butter!<p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="http://www.usingmainlyspoons.com/Blog/labels/baking">baking</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://www.usingmainlyspoons.com/Blog/labels/bread">bread</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://www.usingmainlyspoons.com/Blog/labels/nokneadbread">nokneadbread</a></p><br />

  Christmas cookies</a>
</span><br />
      Food blogs have been awash with cookie recipes recently - those to eat, then &#38; there, those to share with visitors and those to pack up and post off to deserving friends and relations. I have been busy with a variety of recipes this year - some new and some old. But rather than describe all in detail, here is a round-up of my Christmas baking:<br /><br /><strong>Oatmeal and Raisin Cookies</strong><br />These come from a book purchased in America - appropriately enough, the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0395915376?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=usingmainlysp-21&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;camp=1634&#38;creative=6738&#38;creativeASIN=0395915376">The All-American Cookie Book</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=usingmainlysp-21&#38;l=as2&#38;o=2&#38;a=0395915376" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />, and have been a favourite for some time. They are apparently from a bed and breakfast known as Dairy Hollow House, and guests would be presented with one giant cookie in a little bag for their journey home. They are subtly spiced with ginger and cinnamon, and are crispy with just a little chewiness at the centre.<br /><br /><strong>Clementine Sables</strong><br />Inspired by <a href="http://orangette.blogspot.com/">Orangette</a>'s <a href="http://orangette.blogspot.com/2006/12/hop-to-it.html">Meyer lemon sables</a>, and by the Buy One Get One Free offer on <a href="http://www2.marksandspencer.com/foodmagazine/">Marks &#38; Spencer</a>'s clementines, I made these little chill-and-slice shortbread biscuits. My genius discovery is that sanding sugar, used for decorating cakes and cookies, especially in America, can be very cheaply and easily substituted by preserving sugar.<br /><br /><strong>Gingerbread Men<br /></strong>I have never made gingerbread men before, but the Christmassy-ness of them, plus the opportunity to play with icing faces and buttons proved too much to resist. I came across various ginger biscuit recipes at <a href="http://chocolateandzucchini.com/archives/2006/11/biscuits_tres_gingembre.php">Chocolate and Zucchini</a>, <a href="http://www.101cookbooks.com/archives/001536.html">101 Cookbooks</a> and in several of my books, but in the end, I stuck to Nigella's Britishness in <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0701168889?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=usingmainlysp-21&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;camp=1634&#38;creative=6738&#38;creativeASIN=0701168889">How to Be a Domestic Goddess: Baking and the Art of Comfort Cooking</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=usingmainlysp-21&#38;l=as2&#38;o=2&#38;a=0701168889" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />. My only adjustments to her recipe were to reduce the black pepper, and to replace this by ground ginger. The biscuits were appropriately stiff and plain, but the spices developed beautifully over time, and now, a week since baking, they are very fragrant - although the icing did end up sticking them together in the cake tin.<strong><br /><br />Chocolate Macaroons<br /></strong>I love chocolate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macaron">macarons de paris</a>, and have bought them from many places, including <a href="http://www.miettecakes.com/">Miette</a> bakery at the Ferry Plaza building in San Francisco, and from the <a href="http://www.urbanpath.com/london/chinese/yauatcha.htm">Yauatcha</a> concession at the <a href="http://www.viewlondon.co.uk/taste-of-london-food-festival_index.html">Taste of London</a> exhibition this year. However, since my first attempt at baking them myself at cooking school came out badly, I haven't really attempted them again. The main problems are 1) that characteristic smooth and shiny top and 2) the requisite chewiness combined with good chocolate flavour. There is no doubt that it is much easier to make them in the UK, where finely ground almonds are easily obtainable than to grind them yourself. This time I followed Flo Braker's quite precise instruction in her book Sweet Miniatures - some worked very well, others stayed crackly, but they all tasted pretty good :)<strong><br /></strong><br /><!-- technorati tags start --><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/baking" rel="tag">baking</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/christmas" rel="tag">christmas</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/cookies" rel="tag">cookies</a></p><!-- technorati tags end --><br />
