	In the autumn of 2003 we travelled to the other side of the world, journeying
	all around the south island of New Zealand, diving on the Great Barrier Reef 
	and finishing up in Sydney, where the Rugby World Cup was in full swing, and 
	where we became engaged. As we flew home, the captain gave us updates on the 
	England vs Australia World Cup Final, and it was in the middle of the long, 
	long flight back that we discovered that England were now Rugby World Champions
	- we still haven’t seen that match.

	<h3>First Entry 01/09/03</h3>
	<p>54 days to go. Well, this is only the start of the weblog, but this thing 
	has been in the planning for quite a few months now. Last weekend we went to 
	Decathlon (link) in Greenwich to kit ourselves out for our Scuba diving course.
	We are going to do the PADI referral course, which entails doing the Pool & 
	theory work in the UK before heading out. This will allow us to get our PADI 
	Open Water certificate in only a few days when we are in Australia.</p>
	<h3>That sinking feeling... 08/09/03</h3>
	<p>So the diving course is only a few days away now - by the end of this coming
	weekend, we should be as qualified in scuba diving as we're going to be before
	we hit the reef - that's a scary thought, I can tell you. Still, we have a bit
	of the gear already - some very silly looking masks and some hi-tech snorkels
	(who would have thought a simple tube could acquire so many features??).</p>
	<h3>Giant step - qualified divers coming through! - 14/09/03</h3>
	<p>It's official - we have just completed our PADI Open Water Referral Course. 
	OK, so that doesn't mean we're exactly qualified, but it's a start! We went 
	with London Scuba We opted to get it out the way in a single weekend, which 
	was pretty tiring, but definitely worthwhile. Each day started with a session
	on theory in the classroom, followed by an afternoon at the bottom of a swimming
	pool. I started out with a very large tank and a small BCD (Buoyancy Control 
	Device, to those in the know :) which meant I pretty much sank to start with.
	Not good. So after a bit of kit adjustment, I was soon floating or sinking on
	demand, and using a regulator like a pro.</p>
	<h3>Stylesheet shenanigans - 21/09/03</h3>
	<p>Progress on the trip has been limited this week. We just got the hire car 
	in NZ, the interisland ferry and the diving medical to sort out - and then I 
	*think* we're done - but don't quote me because there's always more stuff to do
	at the last minute. We've also been playing with the possibilities of stylesheets
	a fair bit - but more on that next time.</p>
	<h3>#It's the final countdown - 16/10/03</h3>
	<p>9 days to go now and we are officially excited. It's particularly pleasing 
	to tell people that you're going away - for 4 weeks. They generally say something
	along the lines of "How did you manage to swing that?!". Packing has already 
	started, with the intention of scaring us into cutting it down to the absolute
	minimum by the time we go.</p>
	<h3>Getting to the plane - 26/10/03 AM</h3>
	<p>Pretty busy day getting to the plane.
	Lived up to committtment to go blonde. Seemed to take a lot longer than the 
	last time I did it, but at least this time my hai r doesn't feel like straw 
	at the end of it. It's odd, but after a couple hours you forget and you start
	to wonder why people are looking at you strangely. OK - more strangely than 
	usual :). Also managed to increase the going away stress levels by breaking 
	my glasses during the week. we had to dash round to Vision Express (Oxford 
	Circus)in order to get a new pair. Despite Oxford Circus being a warzone, I 
	managed to walk out less than 90 minutes later with a very nice set of Mikli 
	designed glasses. They have the best hinges!</p>
	<h3>Upside down, 5 hours to Bangkok - 26/10/03</h3>
	<p>The economy cabin was really hot. 29.6C according to my watch (and yes it
	is the first time I have had to use that function). It's also pretty cramped.
	Now as far as I am concerned that's fine. Strap on the Sennheiser noise 
	cancelling head phones. Whack on the bindfold. Wake up in Bangkok. Job done.
	Sadly this is not cutting it for Louise. Once we have dispensed with the 
	traditional sickbag, oxygen and cold flannel routine we manage to get to the
	crew section where she has a bit more room to breathe.</p>
	<h3>Somewhat better in Sydney - 27/10/03</h3>
	<p>Louise has gutted it out and seems to be a bit better. The BA crew managed 
	to get us the only empty row in economy so she could lie down and get some 
	sleep on the leg to Sydney - whcih seems to have helped a lot. New record in 
	the cabin before take off: 33.0 degrees! Outstanding...</p>
	<h2>Week 1 - Wellington and Abel Tasman</h2>
	<p>After a staggering 23 and a half hour flight, we will arrive in Wellington. 
	We'll have 2 days here to recover from jetlag and see some of the city. I'll 
	be visiting the national museum, Te Papa, and Nath will probably sleep and 
	therefore be much more recovered than I will by the second day. We also fancy
	rollerblading on the harbour front, because we like rollerblading at home in 
	Hyde Park and it sounds like fun.</br>
	We head from Wellington to Marahau, via the Cooke strait on the Inter-island 
	ferry, Picton and Nelson. There we will be joining a 3-day sea kayaking trip 
	around the coast of this national park, which, like almost everywhere else in
	New Zealand, featured as a location in Lord of the Rings.</p>

	<h3>Made it! - 27/10/03</h3>
	<p>A mere 32h after leaving home we have made it to NZ! An unsteady jet-lagged
	walk around Wellington in the sunshine is a lot of fun - and some dinner at 
	"One Red Dog" goes down nicely. Time for some sleep while we try to work out
	what day it is!</p>
	<h3>Te Papa - 27/10/03</h3>
	<p>Now I am not one for museums. Probably scarred as a child with stately homes.
	(Which I would cheerly burn to the ground en masse incidentally). However, 
	Louise suggests Te Papa (the NZ national museum) as a good thing to do on our
	first wet day. I have to say it is fantastic. They have some great exhibits 
	on the formation and history of NZ, and an enormous collection of great art 
	and sculpture. Top. We spend the whole day here, even taking 90min off in the
	middle of the day for a hot chocolate and a good chat in the fancy-schmancy 
	coffee shop in the middle of the museum.</p>
	<img src="Images/Kayak_ba.jpg" align="right" width="200" alt="kayaks">
	<h3>Kayaking - 2/11/03</h3>
	<p>We have just returned from sea kayaking for 3 days in the Abel Tasman 
	National Park. We set out on Thursday, catching the 7am bus from our motel 
	to the kayaking base. I don't know what it is about Kiwi bus driver, but they
	all seem compelled to give you a guided tour in addition to driving. This is 
	more than a little disconcerting when they are swinging the bus around 180 
	degree hairpin bends at the same time as talking. Anyway, after a hour or so 
	on the bus, and various informationa about the important New Zealanders who 
	own property on that section of road, we arrive at the kayaking base.</br>
	It is raining a little when we arrive, but by the time we're kitted up and 
	ready to head out with the kayaks loaded up with 3 days worth of clothes & 
	food, it is pouring. Now let me be clear, when I booked this kayaking expedition
	with Abel Tasman Kayaks, I looked at the pictures of crystal clear waters, 
	golden beaches, blues skies and thought 'we should definitely try this!'. I 
	did not have in mind paddling in choppy waters, under a leaden sky in persistent
	rain. As it turned out, the rain continued for the rest of the day - solidly. 
	So by the time we landed at our camping spot for the night, I was cold, tired
	and a little seasick. 'I'm really not looking forward to 2 more days of this'
	I was thinking, 'I wonder how one bails out of this trip and gets home early'.
	That evening was much fun for me, or for Nath who had to look after me. However,
	just before sunset, the rain eased and the sky started to clear. By the next 
	morning, the skies were blue, adn the whole thing was starting to look a lot 
	more like the brochures.</br>
	<img src="Images/Anchorage_beach.jpg" align="left" width="200" alt="beach">
	After that first day, the whole trip was great. We looked at caves, watched 
	sea birds and seals, ate our lunches on secluded golden beaches, and even got
	to see glowworms in caves on the beach at night. We had a great guide who 
	knew loads about the park and all the wildlife, which was really useful.</p>
	<h2>Week 2 - South Island Tour</h2>
	<p>This is where we begin our tour of the South Island in earnest. We are 
	planning to visit, amongst other places, Kaikoura for the whale watching, 
	Queenstown for white water sledging (not me - that's all Nathan), Lake Tekapo
	and ending up in Christchurch. From here we fly to Australia to start week 3.</p>
	<h3>Irish bar, English rugby, American country music - 2/11/03</h3>
	<p>When we arrived in Kaikoura, we decided to check in to a B&B called Donegal 
	House. As we pulled in we could hear loud music coming from the bar, and 
	assumed that some sort of Irish celebration was in proqress. As it was quiet
	enough in the rooms we checked in and then went to the restaurant & bar to 
	get some food. There we discovered the source of the singing - the Dixie 
	Chicks were beinq played from DVD on a large screen & at high volume, whilst
	most of the bar watched and occasionally sang along. This was not really what
	we had expected from an Irish bar. Fortunately, the rugby was also being shown
	on a smaller screen, so we settled down to watch England vs. Uruguay. It was 
	a pretty surreal experience in a rugby-mad country to be surrounded by people
	singing along to Cliff Richard, Kenny Rogers & Rod Stewart.</p>
	<img src="Images/Sperm_whale_Kaikoura.jpg" align="right" width="200" alt="whale">
	<h3>Whale watching - 3/11/03</h3>
	<p>After kayaking, we picked up a hire car and drove to Kaikoura on the East 
	coast. The aim there was to do some whale watching. This part of the coast 
	has really deep water not far offshore, and a lot of sealife because of the 
	unique currents that attract dolphins and sperm whales. We went out on the 
	boat despite the sea sickness warnings - we thought they were probably 
	exaggerating. Once out there, it became clear that they were not - Nath & I 
	both managed to hold on to our breakfasts, but with some difficulty! We did 
	get to see a couple of whales though - amazing experience, and really professional
	tour. Did you know that sperm whales hold the record for the deepest dive - 
	3000 metres!</p>
	<h3>Buy a possum - save a tree 4/11/03</h3>
	<p>As with any tourist destination, you quite quickly find out what the big 
	tourist souvenirs are, because they appear in every souvenir shop in every 
	town. Here, the main ones are Paua shell (a type of abalone), bone and jade 
	maori carvings, woollen jumpers (well, they do have a lot of sheep) and possum
	fur. Yes that's right - fur. And the best thing that it's marketed as being 
	an environmentally sound product! How can the environmental lobby and selling
	fur be compatible you ask? The answer is this - the bushtailed possum was 
	introduced from Australia by early settlers in New Zealand, to provide a source
	of fur. In Australia, the possum has a fairly hard life, has to avoid snakes 
	and doesn't get all that much to eat, the Austrlian bush being fairly sparse. 
	However, once in green, forested New Zealand the posssum has a whale of a time
	- there is huge amounts of vegetation, and pretty much no predators. This was 
	all working out OK until people decided that wearing fur was a bad thing, and 
	it no longer became economic to trap possums. Once this happens, their numbers
	soared, to the point where there are now 70 million possums in New Zealand, 
	and they are decimating the vegetation, to the point where many native species
	are under serious threat. Hence the slogan in the title of this article (they 
	really use this slogan on the possum fur goods). </p>

	<h3>Christchurch - 6/11/03</h3>
	<p>Today I am in Christchurch while Nath has flown to Queenstown to go rafting.
	This gives me a chance to see all the sights that Nath is less keen on. I 
	started off by following one of the city walks along the river to the Botanical
	Gardens. Christchurch is a bit of an odd transplant of middle England - a 
	genteel river runs through the centre of town with Horse Chestnut trees & 
	willows on its banks, and punting along it in summer. The river and the gardens
	were both beautiful today in the warm sunshine, but I couldn't help feeling 
	that it was a bit odd to see trees and plants from the other side of the world,
	but very little native flora.</p>
	<img src="Images/Lady_Elliot_from_the_air.jpg" align="right" width="200">		
	<h2>Week 3 - Great Barrier Reef - Lady Elliot Island</h2>
	<p>From Christchurch, we fly to Brisbane and then catch a train to Bundaberg.
	There we stay overnight so that we can catch the first flight to Lady Elliot
	Island in the morning. Lady Elliot Island is the most southerly of the reef
	islands, and we are staying for a week, and doing the PADI Open Water course.
	We hope to see manta rays, turtles, whales, dolphins, eels and loads of fish.</p>
	<img src="Images/View_from_the_bridge.jpg" align="left" width="120">		
	<h2>Week 4 - Sydney</h2>
	<p>Once we've finished on Lady Elliot Island, we fly to Sydney. We're going to 
	stay in and catch up with friends living in Sydney. Nath is also trying to 
	persuade me that it's a good idea to climb the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Hmmm...</p>
